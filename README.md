# Employee Management CRUD Web App

This project is a full-stack employee management web application built with the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). It allows the user to manage employee records by performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The project is designed for **Apollonia Dental Practice**, which requires an initial system to manage employees and their respective departments.

## Features

- Add, update, and delete employees.
- Filter employees by department.
- View a list of all employees.
- RESTful API for backend services.
- Docker support for containerization.
- Automatic deployment to Docker Hub using GitHub Actions.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB, Mongoose
- **API**: RESTful API
- **CSS**: Custom CSS for simple UI
- **Docker**: Docker support for both frontend and backend
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline to push Docker images to Docker Hub

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sunilKmishra18/employee-management-CRUD-web-app.git
cd employee-management-CRUD-web-app
```

### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the `backend` folder and follow the steps:

```bash
cd backend
```

#### 2.1 Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 2.2 Set up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder with the following content:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
PORT=5000
```

Replace `your_mongo_connection_string` with your MongoDB connection URI.

#### 2.3 Run the Backend Server

```bash
npm start
```

The backend server should now be running at `http://localhost:5001`.

### 3. Frontend Setup

Navigate to the `frontend` folder:

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

#### 3.1 Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 3.2 Start the Frontend Server

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend server should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Connecting Frontend to Backend

To ensure the frontend can communicate with the backend, configure a proxy in the `frontend/package.json` file:

```json
"proxy": "http://localhost:5001",
```

### 5. Docker Setup (Optional)

If you wish to deploy this application using Docker, you can do so by creating a `Dockerfile` and configuring it for your environment.

#### 5.1 Build Docker Image Locally

```bash
docker build -t employee-management-app .
```

#### 5.2 Run Docker Container

```bash
docker run -p 5001:5001 employee-management-app
```

### 6. GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

This project comes with a GitHub Actions workflow to automate deployment to Docker Hub.

#### 6.1 Setting up Secrets in GitHub

- Go to your repository's **Settings** > **Secrets** > **Actions**.
- Add the following secrets:
  - `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
  - `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password or personal access token.

#### 6.2 Docker Workflow

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`) is already set up to:

- Build the Docker image when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
- Push the image to Docker Hub.
